# Social-Network-in-Python
The name of this social network is bookface.

To store passwords and such, it uses the google sheets api for python. Naturally the client_secret.json is missing. If you want to run this on your own machine you will have to supply your own credentials by generating a new client_secret.json from the google sheets api. Then paste it into the main directory.

Then run serv.py

The server will then run on port 8080
